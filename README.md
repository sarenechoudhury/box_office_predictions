# Box Office Predictions using an AugBoost Hybrid LightGBMâ€“Neural Regression Model

<br />
<br />

### 1. This model trains an LGBM regressor to predict log-based revenue

### 2. Computes residuals by using a neural network to model the residuals and augments the dataset, adding the ANN's predictions as new features

### 3. Iteratively repeats this process to enrich the data and then trains the final LGBM model on that feature set 

<br />

#### Notes: The box_office_preds file contains an optional feature pruning function that may affect performance depending on specific datasets used. It also contains graphing functions throughout to visualize data at various points, and a few more comments. The box_office_preds_clean file does not contain those.
