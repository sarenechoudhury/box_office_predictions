# Box Office Predictions using an AugBoost Hybrid LightGBMâ€“Neural Regression Model


### 1. This model trains an LGBM regressor to predict log-based revenue

### 2. Computes residuals by using a neural network to model the residuals and augments the dataset, adding the ANN's predictions as new features

### 3. Iteratively repeats this process to enrich the data and then trains the final LGBM model on that feature set
